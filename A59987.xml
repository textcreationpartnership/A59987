            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE various Constructions, which the ensuing <hi>Pamphlet</hi> will unavoidably meet with in the World, makes it reasonable to prepossess the <hi>Reader,</hi> with a favourable opinion of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, which at first blush seems so like an <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> Frenzy, or an absurd <hi>Paradox,</hi> that more than meer <hi>Candour</hi> is required to think otherwise. This bespeaks the necessity of delineating this short Essay upon <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Industry,</hi> in its true and proper colours, by shewing that although the former of these, has been signally promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and encouraged by the latter; yet not to be understood in that Latitude, as to exclude the Grand <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> of Learned, and Ingenious Men: For next to our Blessed Saviour, and his Holy Apostles, we principally owe the Propagation, and Ʋniversal Establishment of <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> to the successful endeavours of the Holy Fathers, and Eminent Doctors of the Church. These have been the chief <hi>Pillars</hi> which sustained the <hi>Fabrick</hi> of the Gospel in
<pb facs="tcp:96817:3"/> all Ages: The <hi>Grand Luminaries</hi> which have <hi>enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened</hi> the <hi>dark</hi> Heathen World with the <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating Rays</hi> of the <hi>Religion</hi> of the Holy <hi>Jesus.</hi> The <hi>burning</hi> and <hi>shining</hi> Lights, which like so many Crystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Lamps appeared the most illustriously, in the midst of divers intricate, and obscure Heresies, unwarrantable Schisms, perverse Heterodoxies, and erroneous Principles. These Learned and Holy Men have <hi>planted</hi> and <hi>watered, cultivated</hi> and <hi>improved</hi> the <hi>Christian Religion;</hi> to which the co-operating Grace of God has mercifully vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed so Miraculous an <hi>increase,</hi> as in some Nations, as well as individual Persons, to bring <hi>forth an hundred fold, in some Sixty, and in some Thirty.</hi> To these sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately to the Gracious Influences of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we owe the blessed effects of those successful and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Offices of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> which by that holy Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, or Conveyance, have been derived to us, through the preaching of the Word, administring of the Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, comforting, and admonishing of the sick, easing and disburthening of troubled Consciences, with other Acts of their Sacred Ministration. And what I have here said of the Divine and Peculiar Excellency of the Ministry in general, I desire may be also so interpreted of the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> and subordinate Spiritual <hi>Pastors</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> in particular, whose admirable Constitution, both in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Discipline, is justly to be accounted superiour to any in the whole Christian World. This being premised of the singular and worthily dignify'd State of the <hi>Clergy:</hi> In the next place, I think fit to add, That though I have represented Industrious and Mechanick Persons as very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental in the disseminating, and advancement of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; yet would have them understood, but as the Sons of <hi>Abinadab,</hi> as so many <hi>Uzza's,</hi> and <hi>Ahioe's,</hi> sit only
<pb facs="tcp:96817:3"/> to drive the <hi>Cart;</hi> but not to touch the <hi>Ark</hi> on which it stands, and consequently, not to invade any part of the <hi>Sacerdotal Function,</hi> which would inflict a punishment upon them, as it did upon <hi>Uzza,</hi> or upon those more noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Usurpers</hi> of the Sacred <hi>Ministry, Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> who for their <hi>Rebellion</hi> against, or rather intrusion upon the Peculiar Divine Offices of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> which they would have prostituted to vulgar and common use, <hi>were swallowed up of the Earth, their Houses, and all the Men that appertained unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But without men of Secular Employments invading the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> there seems a proper <hi>Province</hi> for them, wherein to act, whereby they may abundantly promote <hi>Christianity,</hi> which I have shewn in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, consisting in <hi>Domestick</hi> and private <hi>Converse</hi> and instruction, in which capacity Men of Labour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry both have, and may be very useful, by removing Ignorances in, and Prejudices against <hi>Religion,</hi> and by consequence in mens attaining to some progress in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Doctrine of Christ, and his most Holy Apostles. And if in any place of the following sheets, I seem to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe too much to the performances of Mechanick Men in this case, whereby I may be thought to derogate any thing from that Veneration which is justly attributed to those of the Honourable <hi>Tribe of Levi:</hi> I desire the Reader so to interpret this Discourse, as that in the whole tenour of it is tacitly imply'd a profound acknowledgment of their lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable endeavours, in preference to the other. But this being considered, I could not see how Labour and Industry could be more forcibly recommended in this Lazy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Age, than by demonstrating its even natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the Propagation and Improvement of Religion.
<pb facs="tcp:96817:4"/> For that having entailed upon it an Eternal good, which all mankind do naturally desire to participate of, and Labour and Industry being shewn to be useful Expedients conducing thereunto, must needs be embraced upon their offering so advantagious a prospect, especially when they not only secure to us a future, but also a present Temporal Interest. That we are visibly declined from that active and laborious frame and disposition, which made us at once, the Envy and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Europe,</hi> into all the effeminate Arts of Ease, Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury and Sloth, which has sunk us almost to the lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of an Ʋniversal Contempt with other Nations, is a matter of as much truth as lamentation. In a former Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning <hi>Mechanick Industry,</hi> I proposed some Methods, whereby to revive our declining reputation as to matter of Trade and Laborious Arts, which I evinced to be highly commodious in respect of our Temporal Profit, and the improvement of the Common-wealth. I have now attempted in this small Tract to make out, that the same is also very considerable upon the account of our everlasting and irreversible Estate in the other World, by shewing the mighty power and efficacy of business towards the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and farthering of Religion. And now I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any thing in the World that can more awaken men out of that Lethargick Drowsiness and Sloth, which this Nation seems so deeply involved under, than are one, or both of these <hi>Arguments.</hi> Such as have a regard to their Secular Advantage, must (if they act consistently with their design) be Laborious and Industrious; and those who would purchase a lasting and perpetual Peace, and immortality of Bliss to their Souls, must diligently pursue their lawful Callings, and respective Employments in this Life. This (I know) will seem mysterious and unaccountable to those, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <hi>business</hi> as the greatest Obstacle to <hi>Religion:</hi> but I hope, I have shewn the contrary, when 'tis regularly and prudently managed.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:96817:4"/>
            <p>And now, if this weak Piece, <hi>brought forth</hi> in haste, without the <hi>Midwifery</hi> of Books, or other Learned helps, may conduce any thing to the retrieving of Labour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry amongst us, and to the suppressing of <hi>Idleness</hi> and <hi>Sloth,</hi> and consequently of those Vices which essentially flow, and are derived from thence; the <hi>Author</hi> will have reached his primary and utmost intention in it, and has reason to expect, that a Glowing and Conscientious Zeal for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of <hi>Religion,</hi> added to his ambitioning the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his Native Country, both which he beheld sunk to so low and sordid an Ebb, (the main inducements which prompted him to this undertaking) will with the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and Judicious <hi>Reader</hi> meet with so much Charity and good Nature, as to allow a requisite proportion of each to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a supply of its great, and in rigorous Justice, Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable Imperfections.</p>

            <head>St. PAUL the TENT-MAKER: IN A DISCOURSE, SHEWING How RELIGION has in all Ages, been promoted BY THE Industrious Mechanick.</head>
            <p>THE Title of this Pamphlet tacitly implores the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of that it seems to lessen, and cry down, whereby to explain its meaning: And in regard that the Author professes to bear a vast Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Learned and Ingenious Men, and consequently to be a great Admirer of Humane Literature, and the Sciences; an Invasion upon their just Rights and Prerogatives in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, might justly be interpreted a <hi>Felo de se:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to take off that imputation, he prays the Reader to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his design, in a brief Exposition of it in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, <hi>(viz.) That from the first steps of Christianity to this day, nothing more promoted the true practice of Religion than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, and Employments in business of this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96817:6"/>
            <p>This at first view of it, looks as an apparent <hi>Solecism,</hi> or an egregious contradiction to the generally received Doctrine or Opinion of most Men, who explode Men of Business, and Secular Employments, as deeply immersed in, and even eaten up with the Cares, and Riches, and Intanglements of this life. But in the Sequel of this Discourse, I shall endeavour to evince the contrary, by asserting the truth of the proposition alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy lain down, upon which I will erect some Arguments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to demonstrate the equal necessity of it, as to the enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Employments in Temporal Concerns, as well as to the restraining an immoderate use of them, in relation to our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and more sublime condition.</p>
            <p>In pursuance of which design, I will look back to the first Dawnings of <hi>Christianity,</hi> or Morning-light of the Gospel, in reference whereunto, not to urge any thing in contradiction to the opinion of our Divines, as not desiring to deviate from a due respect to them, I shall not presume to alledge any thing against those Reasons which they give, why our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our made choice of the <hi>Family</hi> of a <hi>Mechanick,</hi> when as the <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>David</hi> abounded with such variety of Persons of more eminent Quality and Extraction, as well as of Nobler Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the World. The use that I shall only make of that Observation, will be, to deduce the one or both of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from it: That either our Blessed Saviour pitched upon this, whereby to evidence unto the World, the Divine Pleasure of his Heavenly Father, in respecting Men of Labour, in preference to such as devote themselves to their own ease, and live at the cost of other Men, by eating of the fruits of their pains and toil; or else, that the poorer sort of the Tribe and Family of <hi>David,</hi> were educated to <hi>Mechanick Arts.</hi> This in the second place.</p>
            <p>I think it rational to infer from the premised Observation, because the Holy Prophets in the Old Testament, declared it to be the determinate Will of God, and their Predictions concerning the manner of his appearance in this lower World, did all centre and concur in this, that our Saviour should come in the meanest condition, and lowest Estate of Mankind. From whence it follows, that either of these Instances, or both, do vertually imply, or rather formally prove, that <hi>Christianity</hi> from its original appearance, or ushering into the World, was attended by Mechanicks.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:96817:6"/>
            <p>And to demonstrate that both in the order of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Providence, Trade</hi> and <hi>Business</hi> must be antecedent to, and in the true acception of the word, prevent our Spiritual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, and that we must be <hi>Labourers</hi> in our own <hi>Vineyards,</hi> before we can be so in that of our <hi>Saviour's;</hi> 'tis very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that we find him a <hi>Carpenter</hi> before he was a Preacher. For altho' his <hi>Divinity</hi> like the <hi>Beams</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> out of a thick Cloud, shone with so strong an influence, as to irradiate and break through his <hi>Infant Humanity,</hi> when in the Temple he so strongly argued and disputed with the Learned <hi>Rabbies</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> yet afterwards the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are silent as to an account of him for many Years: In which interval from the <hi>Twelfth Year</hi> of his <hi>Age</hi> (for in that Minority, we are assured it was that he puzzled and non-plus'd the most Learned among the <hi>Jews</hi>) to his <hi>Thirtieth,</hi> (the time of his <hi>Solemn Inauguration</hi> into his Priestly Office) many Learned Men suppose him to have applyed himself to the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Joseph,</hi> whom the Incredulous and Obstinate <hi>Jews,</hi> looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as his <hi>Father,</hi> and maliciously to lessen the greatness of the Miracles which he wrought, endeavoured what in them lay, (by vile Reflections upon his supposed Birth, Parentage, and Education) to derogate from their true and supernatural worth, and so were wont to reproach him with these Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>Is not this</hi> Joseph<hi>'s Son?</hi> Intimating his supposed origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: And in another place, <hi>Is not this the Carpenter?</hi> By way of contempt of his Vulgar Occupation and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But now that he hath assumed his Sacerdotal Function, let us follow him in the actual discharge of it; in his entrance whereupon, we find that he selected some particular Persons as his <hi>Disciples</hi> and <hi>Followers.</hi> Who these were, of what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct <hi>Callings</hi> and <hi>Vocations,</hi> and how employed, cannot be unknown to any who are but in the least conversant in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oracles of the Gospel. I know it will be here objected, that his choice of such persons that were of ordinary, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick Employments, was on purpose to manifest his <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and to convince both the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that he was the Christ, by capacitating such mean and illiterate Men, to become the Miraculous Instruments of Preaching, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of his Doctrine, by many Supernatural Signs and
<pb facs="tcp:96817:7"/> Wonders, and that to all Nations, in their respective Tongues and Languages.</p>
            <p>To which I Answer, That allowing of all this, which I know to be the received Opinion of <hi>Divines,</hi> it does not therefore follow, but that our Blessed Saviour might have made his being the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> still more eminent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious, in calling of a Rank and Order of Men yet <hi>inferiour</hi> to these, as low and contemptible as they were; and these might have been <hi>Beggars</hi> who had no Employment: but we find that our Saviour passes by such, and calls Men from their Occupations, which seems to be a plain Argument, That as <hi>Labour</hi> was an appendant <hi>Curse,</hi> or Penal Imposition, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the wilful Apostasie of the <hi>first Adam;</hi> so it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sanctify'd, not removed or taken away by the <hi>Second.</hi> For that Judgment pronounc'd by God to <hi>Adam</hi> upon the occasion of his Fall, was to the end of the World irreversible and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, and consequently a standing <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Memorial</hi> of his laps'd condition to all successive Generations of Mankind, namely, <hi>In the Sweat of thy Face shalt thou eat Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among those numerous, and ridiculous Absurdities, which are but too evident in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> a <hi>Monastick,</hi> or recluse life of <hi>Idlers,</hi> seems not the most inconsiderable. And whatever may be said as to the ancient custom of a private recess, or solitary retirement from the World, in order to a more close pursuit of their Devotions and Spiritual Exercises of Religion, which the Cares and Pleasures, the hurry and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances of this Life, are but too apt to cross and oppose, though perhaps those who are capable of a regular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Affections and Passions, so as in due measure and proportion to make the Affairs of this World subordinate to those of <hi>Religion,</hi> may by their publick Examples of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> and <hi>Industry,</hi> be more instrumental both to the Temporal and Eternal Welfare of a Community of People, than such can be expected to be, who shut themselves up in a <hi>Cloyster,</hi> though they should live up to the rigour of their order, and its fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Votaries,</hi> that they are of the first <hi>Class</hi> in Christianity, yet their apparent indulging of themselves in <hi>Idleness</hi> and <hi>Luxury,</hi> in <hi>Sensuality</hi> and <hi>Voluptuousness,</hi> and many of them in those no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious sins of <hi>Drunkenness</hi> and <hi>Ʋncleanness,</hi> though commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with great Secrecy, to prevent discovery and the eye of the World, are all of them undoubted <hi>Characteristicks,</hi> not only of their opposing of the Doctrine of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> but even that of their own Institution, into what corruption soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver 'tis now degenerated. Thus those who aspire to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Room in Religion, or at least pretend to it, act diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally contrary to the Blessed and Vertuous Example of that great <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> whom, they would induce Men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they are desirous to follow, but who never insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a Society of <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> or <hi>Beggars,</hi> to live in <hi>Idleness,</hi> and in all vitious and unlawful excess. And we never read, that he <hi>went about</hi> receiving, (as those of <hi>Mendicant</hi> Orders do) but always <hi>doing good.</hi> We need therefore no farther as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of the errour and falshood of that Religion, whose <hi>Godliness</hi> is <hi>Gain;</hi> from such we ought to withdraw our selves, as <hi>not having</hi> so <hi>learned Christ.</hi> And by these <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,</hi> we may easily discern it to be that professed in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church,</hi> or rather <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to our Saviour's pitching upon Men of a Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Inferiour Rank, and mean Employments in the World, to be his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sciples and <hi>Successors,</hi> let us after this choice pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue them in their Practices, and we shall find that this especial Invitation of our Saviour, to the execution of the Sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Disciple, or <hi>Follower</hi> of the Holy <hi>Jesus,</hi> did not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persede their former Occupations, nor their Heavenly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment give a Dispensation to, or take them off from their Temporal. And though it might have been reasonably ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that Christs extraordinary <hi>Promise</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> when he was Fishing, <hi>That he would make him a Fisher of Men,</hi> seemed so ample a Commission for exercising himself altogether in the Divine Offices of Conversion and Salvation of Mankind, as to give a Plenary Discharge from his former mean Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet by the consequence we may understand, that this was none of our Saviours Intention. For after this, we find St. <hi>Peter</hi> at his Trade; and 'tis observable, that the first Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, or rather (I may say) that which was solely wrought
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96817:8"/> by Christ after his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> was giving a Temporal Blessing to their <hi>Labour,</hi> which seems, to amount almost to a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, that of <hi>such</hi> Industrious Persons <hi>were the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to me it seems an aggravating Circumstance of that great Curse that attended the <hi>fallen Angels,</hi> that they were divested of all Business and Employment; they were now no longer in a capacity of praising or magnifying God: And as to obedience to his Commands, they had already shewn an obstinate refusal. From this Infamous original, our Idle <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi> that contemn Employments, may derive the <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of their <hi>Families,</hi> and indeed too many of them are the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate Off-spring</hi> of that degenerated <hi>Stock,</hi> who having wound himself into that evil Employment of tempting <hi>Eve,</hi> has ever since been extream active in doing mischief, whose bad example such persons amongst us as do but too industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously imitate and transcribe, who wholly devote themselves to Pleasure and Licentiousness. For the Principles of Human Nature being capable of, or rather essentially subject to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and continual motion, it is therefore impossible for Man to poize himself so equally in the World, as neither to do good nor evil. 'Tis true indeed that the Body may be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, or by reason subjected to something of a neutrality in this case, or more properly may be restrain'd within such bounds of <hi>moderation,</hi> as not to make any great Excursions into an <hi>extream,</hi> but the <hi>thoughts</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> being of a more subtil and active quality, are not capable of such a limitation, but operating by a certain Independency or Arbitrary Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, must either be employed upon good <hi>Objects</hi> to divert them from bad, or else for want of the former they have a natural recourse and tendency unto the latter, and by this means do oftentimes move their <hi>Instrument</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> by such strong impressions, as to encline it to the reducing of them into <hi>act;</hi> for which reason it is, that we are told, that from the <hi>thoughts</hi> of the Heart proceed <hi>Murthers, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now since 'tis impossible to chain up <hi>thoughts,</hi> (which are a kind of spiritous extract, or quintessential part of the Soul, proceeding from it like the Beams from the <hi>Sun,</hi> and acting the Body by a Parallel Influence with the <hi>Rays</hi> of that grand
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96817:8"/>
               <hi>Luminary,</hi> when it extends them to this lower World) it seems then to be the reason why our <hi>Saviour</hi> so encouraged <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Employments,</hi> that by means thereof we may so keep our <hi>thoughts</hi> in action, as not to suffer them to ramble upon other <hi>Objects,</hi> than those of our <hi>lawful Callings,</hi> and so may check the violent intrusion of <hi>Vitious thoughts</hi> with that of the <hi>Father,</hi> (viz.) <hi>that we are not at leisure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoughts are the <hi>Instruments</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and should not be admitted into vulgar <hi>heads,</hi> no more than a <hi>Knife</hi> into the Hand of a <hi>Child;</hi> and since there is no way to limit or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine them in themselves, the best expedient is to give them a powerful <hi>diversion,</hi> by meeting and entertaining them with such <hi>Objects</hi> as are conducible thereunto, which to proportion agreeably to the different sorts and capacities of Men in the World, would be to employ the <hi>Populace</hi> with <hi>Mechanick Labour,</hi> and the finer and more Speculative Heads, with <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> that so there might be no Sett of Men, as now there is, governed by the unruly Dictates of evil Thoughts.</p>
            <p>By a serious reflection upon this first <hi>Paragraph,</hi> it is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to every Man, that the choice and practice of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the introduction of <hi>Christianity,</hi> was directed to the encouragement of <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Industry,</hi> and that the Grace of God was given to such <hi>Servants</hi> as <hi>employed their Temporal Talent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now in the next place enquire into the Behaviour and Practice of the <hi>Apostles</hi> after our Blessed Lord's Ascension. And if any may expect or challenge an Immunity from Labour of the hands, we may suppose it to be these Men who were peculiarly commissioned, and so miraculously endowed with such power, and so great a proportion of the Divine Spirit for the promulgation of the Gospel, as seemed to make that of their <hi>Ministry</hi> the only Province wherein they were to act. Add to this, that they were commanded to Preach the <hi>Gospel</hi> to all Nations, and that continually in their Travels these Holy Men wrought Miracles, Cured Diseases, and Converted <hi>three thousand</hi> at a Sermon, where it is reasonable enough to believe, that there were not a few, both able and willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to relieve the famous <hi>Instruments</hi> of their Salvation; yet for all this, we find that they wrought with their own
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96817:9"/>
               <hi>hands;</hi> and notwithstanding that many of the Saints sold what they had, and laid it at the <hi>Apostles</hi> feet: yet did they not Convert it to their own use, but dispersed it among the poor <hi>Brethren,</hi> not to maintain them in Idleness and Sloth, but to put them into a capacity of obtaining their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: and this <hi>Charity</hi> was not dispensed by the usual Method of this Age, by a Penny at the <hi>Door,</hi> to preserve <hi>Vermin</hi> in the <hi>Street;</hi> for such are the <hi>Common Vagrant Beggars,</hi> that both the <hi>Law</hi> of God, and that of the <hi>Land,</hi> not only forbid our relieving, but enjoyn Punishment too; yet such is the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of <hi>Custom</hi> with some, and of <hi>Vain Glory</hi> and <hi>Ostentation</hi> in others, as induce too many to violate both.</p>
            <p>But to return to the <hi>Apostles</hi> working with their own hands, I do not hence infer, that there was any necessity for them so to do: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or St. <hi>Paul</hi> has told us, That if they sowed <hi>Spiritual</hi> things, they might well reap <hi>Carnal</hi> things, and that the <hi>Oxe</hi> is not to be <hi>muzled</hi> that <hi>treadeth</hi> out the <hi>Corn;</hi> with variety of other places to this purpose, which enforce a Due to the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> and to others that succeed them in their <hi>Ministry;</hi> and consequently that our present Clergy have a Right of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tythes,</hi> neither are under any obligation of Working with their Hands; as I have shewn that the <hi>Apostles</hi> were not. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> (notwithstanding that he did so) told the <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians,</hi> That he might have lived on his <hi>Ministry;</hi> yet he and the other <hi>Apostles</hi> chose rather to work with their own hands night and day; and he gives this reason for it (which is what I would infer from, and principally aim at in this Discourse) that he might be an example to them of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by promote Labour and Industry. He tells them therefore by way of repetition, what his Doctrine was when among them, that they should <hi>work</hi> with their <hi>own hands,</hi> and study to be <hi>quiet;</hi> as if <hi>Idleness</hi> tended to create Discords and Animosities among them, fomented by such as had nothing else to do, and whose <hi>Sloth</hi> had so impaired their Fortunes, as seemed to put them upon a necessity of retrieving themselves, by raising Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances and Confusions in the <hi>Countrey:</hi> and that on the contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, a diligent pursuit of their respective Vocations and Callings, the best means of begetting <hi>Peace</hi> and Unanimity with one another. And farther, enjoyns a punishment to such as did not <hi>Labour,</hi> by ordaining that they should not eat; which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96817:9"/> not <hi>eating</hi> seems (with submission to better Judgments) to mean a prohibition from the <hi>Lord's Table,</hi> which looks like the <hi>true,</hi> though contrary to the <hi>vulgar,</hi> Acception: And my reason for this Opinion is,</p>
            <p>First, That it seems not practicable that the <hi>Church</hi> in the days of the Apostles, who had no Temporal <hi>Authority,</hi> could take away the Means of Mens Temporal Support; nor do we ever read, that any <hi>Christian Church</hi> (but that of <hi>Rome</hi>) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Pecuniary Punishments for sins.</p>
            <p>Another reason is deduced from the following Verses of the Chapter, where the <hi>Apostle</hi> seems to explain himself; <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>I hear there are some among you that work not at all: Now such</hi> (saith he) <hi>let them work, and eat their own Bread.</hi> The former it seems were not quite <hi>idle,</hi> but only faulty in <hi>part,</hi> and therefore were to be restrained, whilst they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued so, from the <hi>Lord's Table:</hi> but the latter were totally guilty, and must first he reformed by <hi>eating</hi> of their own <hi>Bread;</hi> that is, by the purchace of their <hi>Labour,</hi> before they could be admitted into the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what we have already premised, both as to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Exemplary Practice,</hi> and strict Injunctions of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> it appears sufficiently plain, That each of these respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, as well as all of them, did jointly tend to a redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Men from Idleness, as being looked upon by them as the first introductory step of their <hi>Conversion to the Christian Religion.</hi> The Door is shut, and no entrance is admitted to the <hi>evil Spirit,</hi> where Men are busied in just and lawful Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments: whereas indeed <hi>idleness</hi> is the source and inlet to all manner of <hi>Vice,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> will certainly be most active when he finds Men at leisure to receive his impressions. He will then shoot his <hi>poisonous Arrows,</hi> when the <hi>Mark stands</hi> so <hi>fair,</hi> and Men for want of <hi>business</hi> seem prepared for his wicked Influences and Suggestions. <hi>Experience</hi> has fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed him how to improve all opportunities, and it would reflect upon his <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Policy,</hi> not to make an <hi>attack</hi> when the <hi>Garrison</hi> is in such a Lethargy that it cannot be rous'd up to any vigorous opposition. Besides, we must consider that <hi>Idleness</hi> does not only leave room for the Temptations of the common Enemy of Mankind, to operate successfully upon us, but it also raises a <hi>Storm</hi> within our own Breasts, by naturally
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96817:10"/> encreasing unlawful <hi>Lusts,</hi> and vile Concupiscences, which like combustible matter meeting with the <hi>fuel</hi> of outward <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements,</hi> which <hi>Satan</hi> skilfully accommodates to the evil <hi>Genius</hi> of our vitious and depraved Affections, must needs resolve into a <hi>Flame.</hi> Whereas <hi>Labour</hi> and Industry do not only put a stop to Temptations, by not affording leisure to our thoughts to dwell and ruminate upon them; but also are a good expedient to keep the Body in a due subjection to an even and regular <hi>decorum,</hi> and consequently to the subduing of extravagant and sinful desires. Therefore Men that are busily employed upon their lawful occasions, are like <hi>Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> secure within their <hi>Circle,</hi> both from the <hi>Snares</hi> and Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of the Tempter, as well as from those of their own <hi>Lusts:</hi> both which an Idle Person is constantly exposed to.</p>
            <p>It is very remarkable, that we do not in all the <hi>Scriptures</hi> read of any possessed with <hi>Devils,</hi> that were Men of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gadarenes</hi> were an Industrious People, perhaps had there been many <hi>Idlers,</hi> the <hi>Legion</hi> had not crowded into one Man; and when our Saviour turned them out, they made it not their request to enter into the <hi>Herds-man</hi> that kept the <hi>Swine,</hi> though as near to them as the <hi>Herd:</hi> For that <hi>poor Wretch</hi> was upon his lawful Employment, which was an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote</hi> and <hi>counter-charm</hi> against the entrance of these <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> into him.</p>
            <p>'Tis matter of Lamentation to consider, that in an Age wherein the <hi>Sins</hi> of <hi>Sodom</hi> abound with so great predominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, there should be so few <hi>Lots</hi> to Preach against that remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able one of <hi>idleness.</hi> Some will be apt to draw this inference from that omission, that many of our <hi>Divines</hi> say with <hi>Lot</hi> concerning <hi>Zoar, Is it not a little one?</hi> A Gentleman's Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and so not to be invaded? A <hi>Birth-right</hi> indeed to the Posterity of <hi>Esau,</hi> who we find had that quality inherent to a Gentleman in the present Age, which still to continue the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel,</hi> was in <hi>use,</hi> a <hi>good Hunter:</hi> but we find that the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> were better employed in imitation of the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi> their <hi>Father, who was a plain Man, but a good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:96817:10"/>
            <p>Indeed it seems very unaccountable, that some <hi>Pulpits</hi> are full of Reproofs against the <hi>Off-spring,</hi> and yet silent as to the <hi>Parent</hi> of all <hi>Sin,</hi> which is <hi>idleness.</hi> Whereas, if what the Logicians affirm be true, That <hi>Sublatâ causâ, tollitur effectus:</hi> It seems the best method to pull down <hi>vice,</hi> by beginning at the <hi>root</hi> of it, which being destroyed, no more nourishment can be imparted to the <hi>Branches.</hi> Now 'tis plain, that Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is the <hi>Foundation,</hi> and that other sins which naturally arise from it, are but the <hi>Superstructures</hi> of Impiety. 'Tis that which is the <hi>Origine</hi> and <hi>Fountain</hi> of all manner of wickedness, and other sins are but the <hi>Streams</hi> which flow from it: and if we would stop or divert the <hi>Current,</hi> we must apply our selves to Labour and Industry, which however great Men seem to claim a certain Dispensation or Immunity from, and think themselves free and at loose for their Pleasures; yet we meet with no such exemption for them, either in <hi>Sacred,</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors,</hi> but contrary to that, such have been always stigmatized with the Ignominious Characters of <hi>Effeminacy</hi> and <hi>Luxury,</hi> who addicted themselves to Sloth and Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness: And others dignify'd with the highest <hi>Panegyricks,</hi> and utmost efforts of Human Praises, who were painful and Industrious. As for example, what a Reflection was it upon the Greatness and Wisdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> to give himself such a licentious freedom in all those <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Pleasures</hi> which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards pronounced to be <hi>Vanity of Vanities, and Vexation of Spirit?</hi> And after making an experiment of their insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, recommends the study of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Industry,</hi> as the <hi>only true Wisdom.</hi> On the contrary, How much did it redound to the infinite Commendation of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> so eminent an <hi>Apostle</hi> and so <hi>Learned</hi> a <hi>Doctor, bred up at the feet of</hi> Gamaliel, and Commissioned to Preach the <hi>Gospel</hi> to the remotest, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most parts of the Universe, to work with his own hands, when there was neither any obligation nor necessity for him so to do?

On the other hand, With what Infamy and Contempt do Men mention the Names of <hi>Vitellius</hi> and <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance more of those <hi>Bestial Monsters,</hi> who sat at the Helm of

It were highly to be wished that our <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants</hi> of the <hi>Age,</hi> would from these and the like Precedents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that the way to Immortalize their Names to Posterity, and to render them serviceable in the <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Common-wealth</hi> wherein they live, is by applying themselves to such Arts and Exercises of <hi>Industry,</hi> as may be suitable to their respective Educations and Capacities, and not to think themselves disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged from all business, because their <hi>Birth</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> seat them above the <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of mean Employments: For all-wise Providence has composed all things in this World by so exact an harmony, as to make every part of it capable of discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its incumbent Office, by a due and regular <hi>proportion;</hi> so that as in the <hi>Microcosm,</hi> or little World of Man, every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Member is intitled to its proper Function, which it is obliged to perform, though some more honourably than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; so in a <hi>Body Politick</hi> every individual person stands bound to acquit himself of that Employment in the <hi>State,</hi> which <hi>God and Nature,</hi> his own Education, and the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his <hi>Superiors</hi> has rendered him capable of; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if none were obliged to business, but such whose Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, and <hi>Vulgar</hi> Extraction enforced to it, whereby to obtain a Livelihood, the whole <hi>burthen</hi> of the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> must lie upon the <hi>Shoulders</hi> of the <hi>Populace,</hi> and then a <hi>wise Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> might well be expected, when Employments of the highest dignity and moment, were committed to the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such <hi>Plebeian Heads,</hi> whose Illiterate Breeding would make them wholly unapt for such undertakings: and yet this consequence must needs be entailed upon that erroneous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which too many Gentlemen by their present Practices seem to maintain: Namely, that a Competent Estate disobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them from business, and by consequence, gives them an unlimited freedom of pursuing their Pleasures at random; notwithstanding that we find that both now and in former
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96817:11"/> Ages (as has been hinted already) that Men of <hi>action</hi> were those who entituled themselves to any <hi>credit</hi> or reputation in the World: And although such as indeavour to do so now, proceed by <hi>Slaughters,</hi> and enslaving Kingdoms; yet when the World was less vitious, and Men of more sedate and less turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Dispositions, the greatest <hi>Heroes</hi> wore the Laurels of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Industry;</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> not only gave up <hi>themselves,</hi> but even their <hi>Names</hi> to be honoured with that of their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structors,</hi> as the <hi>Oenofrians</hi> of <hi>Italus</hi> to be called <hi>Italians,</hi> after that he had taught them the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Husbandry.</hi> Nay, their great veneration and esteem which they had for such, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that excess, till at last they adored them as <hi>Gods,</hi> that put them upon <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Labour.</hi> But I must beg pardon for this Digression from my first design of proving, That <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> reformed these <hi>Heathens</hi> to Christianity, as <hi>Labour</hi> did first from <hi>Bestiality</hi> to <hi>Humanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the prosecution of this Discourse, we have already pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through the <hi>Lives</hi> of our Blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> and of his <hi>Holy Apostles,</hi> in the course whereof we find the agreeableness of their own <hi>practice,</hi> with that of their <hi>Doctrine, working with their own hands,</hi> as already mentioned, and so far from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any thing of their <hi>Converts,</hi> though they told them that they might lawfully have done it, that even we find St. <hi>Paul</hi> discharging a Debt of a <hi>Convert</hi> due from him to his <hi>Master,</hi> that was also one of the same Apostles <hi>Followers,</hi> likewise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising that the <hi>Servant</hi> should for the future be more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And in this place we may fitly observe the great Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion used by the Apostle, not to interfere <hi>Religion</hi> with <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar business,</hi> but (as it were) made the <hi>better,</hi> the <hi>greater give place to the lesser;</hi> that so no Man should pretend an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of lessening his <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Industry</hi> upon the account of <hi>Religion.</hi> To illustrate this to you, we must believe, that this <hi>Onesimus</hi> was a <hi>Mechanick,</hi> and upon that account profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his <hi>Master.</hi> The Apostle we find wanted a Servant, being (as he soon after calls himself) <hi>Paul the Aged;</hi> and may reasonably be thought would not have been denied him, if desired; but 'tis plain, that he would give no such example of Mens deserting their Temporal to espouse the Spiritual <hi>Calling,</hi> they were by the <hi>God</hi> they Worshipped <hi>joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and therefore <hi>no Man</hi> was to <hi>put them asunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:96817:12"/>
            <p>But now that we have taken this <hi>prospect</hi> of what both the <hi>Apostles Preaching</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> was in this <hi>case,</hi> let us in the next place see, what Approbation and Encomiums were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to such as pursued both their Doctrine and Example in this particular, and with it, enquire what other Qualities and Endowments are commended in <hi>Holy Writ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in order to this, I think it not amiss to observe, that in all the <hi>Apostles</hi> Writings, a greater <hi>Character</hi> is not given to any of their <hi>Converts,</hi> than to the <hi>Industry</hi> of a <hi>Woman,</hi> of which to shew God's great acceptance and encouragement, a <hi>Miracle</hi> was wrought to bring her back, that so she might excite others to that <hi>Labour,</hi> of which she was in her own person so exemplary and remarkable an Instance. That she was a Woman of great Piety, is beyond all doubt, and had she been so in these days, her best Friends would have thought it her highest <hi>Encomium,</hi> to have enumerated her Hours, and Days of Devotion, and to have left out her Works of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Worldly Employment: but we see that the Holy Spirit thought fit to do otherwise, by being silent as to the former, but giving us an ample account of the latter, which tacitly interprets unto us, That <hi>Religion</hi> affords no <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> or is any shelter for Idleness and Sloth to repair to: But on the contrary, is the greatest Tye and Obligation to business that can be imposed upon Humane Nature. This may look like a <hi>Paradox</hi> to some, who measure the Duty of a Christian by the frequency of acts of Devotion either publickly in the Church, or privately in the Closet; that considering both the Doctrine of Christ and of his Apostles to be chiefly levelled at the advancement of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the debasing of our <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Interests,</hi> thence infer, That they can never too zealously adhere to the former, or too much relinquish and abandon the latter.</p>
            <p>But it is to be considered, that our Saviour and his Apostles well understood the remisness, or rather averseness of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to acts of Divine Worship, and therefore accounted it more necessary to press their due observance, than that of our Temporal advantage, to which our depraved Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did but too violently hurry and transport us; otherwise, unless we will own that they contradict themselves (a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition as irrational as 'tis odious to a <hi>Christian</hi>) we cannot but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96817:12"/> acknowledge, that <hi>Christianity</hi> carries no inconsistence with the pursuit of our <hi>Lawful Callings:</hi> That Religion and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness are not incompatible, but that as we are obliged to serve God in our Devotions, so to provide for our selves and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in our Worldly Transactions. An Omission whereof is by the Apostle accounted, not an advancing but a degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Christianity</hi> below that of absolute <hi>Gentilism.</hi> And the Apostles reasoning in this case, is both plain and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, if we consider, that not only the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> in its first Institution, did <hi>unalterably</hi> bind all Mankind to such acts of Industry, as might <hi>tend</hi> to a <hi>preservation</hi> of <hi>themselves,</hi> their Families and Posterities; but even the <hi>corrupt</hi> Principles of it, in the <hi>Degenerate Heathens,</hi> wrought with so strong an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as to conclude themselves bound to Labour upon the same account.</p>
            <p>Now if our Saviour's coming into the World was not to destroy, but to correct the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Corruptions crept into that Law</hi> by the depraved <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Interests</hi> of Men, which had strangely byassed and <hi>perverted</hi> its Original rectitude and design; and not only to reduce <hi>it</hi> to its former straitness, but to improve every <hi>part</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> of it to an higher per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection than it was capable of before, it must needs follow, That by so much we are the more obliged to Industry by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> by how much <hi>its enforcement thereunto,</hi> exceeds <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Christianity</hi> has <hi>adopted those things,</hi> which Men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly stiled acts of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Morality,</hi> into the number of such as are <hi>Religious:</hi> by which it comes to pass, that Men as really serve God in their <hi>Callings,</hi> as in their <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate attendance</hi> upon Divine Worship. He that has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to <hi>Pray,</hi> to hear the <hi>Word,</hi> to receive the <hi>Blessed Sacrament,</hi> and to perform other <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Devotion,</hi> has also bid us to work with our hands, to be Industrious in our several <hi>Stations,</hi> to follow the <hi>business</hi> of our <hi>Callings,</hi> and the like, and in obedience <hi>to the latter</hi> of <hi>these</hi> Precepts, we Worship and Adore the Divine Majesty, as really as in the former: Nay, without <hi>these,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> are of small use or <hi>advantage</hi> unto us, are not very (if at all) acceptable to the Throne of Grace, nor derive to us any considerable Blessings from thence. On the contrary, this <hi>pulling down</hi> with one <hi>hand</hi> what we set up
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96817:13"/> by <hi>another,</hi> this extremity in <hi>Religion</hi> to the neglect of our <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>lawful business,</hi> obstructs the Divine Favours, and will make all our toil in Religion turn to no good account: And the reason is, because we endeavour to storm Heaven, in a way contrary to the revealed Will of God: Strive to be Religious, by committing of a Crime, and in truth do evil, that good may come of it. I speak not this to discourage Men from making all that proficiency in <hi>Religion,</hi> which they can possibly attain to provided that they pursue those Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures which are conducible to that end. I think it impossible for Men to <hi>fast</hi> and <hi>prey,</hi> and to repair to their <hi>publick</hi> and private Devotions too frequently, if these Duties be so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned as not to hinder those others which they owe to themselves and <hi>Families,</hi> which both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> require from them. Neither would I, by any means, have Mens <hi>avarice</hi> to slacken and interrupt their <hi>zeal,</hi> upon a pretence of making a necessary provision for their <hi>subsistence</hi> in this World. This, I'm sensible, is a thing, which is, and may be improved to very ill Consequences. Men are apt to make a <hi>sinister use</hi> of that <hi>liberty</hi> which God has given them of following their <hi>lawful Callings,</hi> by pursuing them to that height, as to neglect their <hi>Duties</hi> in <hi>Religion:</hi> And more there are that run to <hi>this,</hi> than to the other <hi>extream,</hi> and require the application of <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Causticks</hi> to remove their <hi>Disease,</hi> must be sharply repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for so <hi>foul</hi> an <hi>errour.</hi> But the <hi>other</hi> being reckoned one of the <hi>right hand,</hi> deserve a <hi>mild</hi> and <hi>gentle usage,</hi> and must be managed by <hi>Lenitives,</hi> and meek Arts of Perswasion. To such, as it is necessary to give all due encouragement to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Progress in <hi>Religion,</hi> and to animate them to a constant perseverance in the ways of Piety, so mildly to insinuate that 'tis not a <hi>moderate,</hi> but an <hi>inordinate pursuit</hi> of <hi>worldly business,</hi> which interferes with, or carrys any opposition to the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</hi> Otherwise, that 'tis so far from being a sin, that 'tis an indispensable duty, in some indeed, to an higher degree than others, suitably to their respective Circumstances or Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World. And this is a truth which we cannot but be the more unquestionably convinced of, if we consider how great a part of that <hi>duty</hi> which we owe to <hi>God,</hi> and by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Holy Apostles</hi> devolved upon our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> as the <hi>grand Mark</hi> and <hi>Characteristick</hi> of our unfeigned <hi>Love</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96817:13"/> Now 'tis plain, that the more diligently we pursue our several <hi>Callings,</hi> the more we are capacitated, not only to provide a competent subsistence for our <hi>selves, friends,</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> which <hi>Nature</hi> more immediately binds us to relieve, but also to extend our <hi>Charity</hi> to such as are in Poverty and Distress; a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> most acceptable unto God, and which he is better pleased with, than the bare <hi>Obedience</hi> of the <hi>Calves</hi> of our <hi>Lips.</hi> And to me it seems no Contemptible Argument, that <hi>Religion</hi> is highly promoted by <hi>Industry</hi> (the Subject of this Discourse) seeing that nothing so enables a Man to be chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as that; and none are ignorant that <hi>Charity</hi> is a most <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> and in the <hi>whole</hi> (of which that of <hi>Alms-giving</hi> is a part) preferable to all others in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>But not to insist longer upon this point, nor to enumerate more <hi>Instances</hi> out of <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> of such who are famed by the Infallible <hi>Pen-man</hi> for their great <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Industry,</hi> I will in the next place descend to the practice of the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> in this case: And if I should wade into Antiquity, and undertake to ransack the account given us of those early times of the Gospel, I might present the Reader with such an inexhaustible treasure of Examples of this kind, as would fill a Volume, and consequently be very disproportionable to the brevity designed in this Discourse. I shall therefore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one for all, which is that of the <hi>Abassine Churches,</hi> first Converted to <hi>Christianity</hi> by the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> Baptized by <hi>Philip,</hi> but improved by the Preaching of St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> The Priests of those Churches get their Livings by <hi>Labour,</hi> and to oblige them to be the more industrious in it, they are not permitted to receive or beg any thing of the People; and however they seem to have lost much of, and to have sensibly degenerated from the purity of that Doctrine which was delivered by their first Teachers and Instructors; yet that part of it which the <hi>Apostles</hi> recommended as a standing rule to be taught, and inculcated to the People, is to this day inviolably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by the <hi>Priest,</hi> for an Example to his Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:96817:14"/>
            <p>But to descend to later Ages of the World, we shall find, that in all, or whatever parts of it that <hi>Christianity</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth, there the <hi>People</hi> are remarkable for their <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Industry:</hi> But in making so large an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> I must crave leave to limit my Assertion to the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> as they are distinguished from that of <hi>Rome,</hi> whose degeneracy into <hi>Heathenish Idolatry,</hi> and into diverse, if not all of the lewd, and vitious Courses of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> has consequently revived that <hi>idleness</hi> and Luxury which was predominant amongst them, which as <hi>Christianity</hi> in its first Establishment, did in a great measure <hi>eradicate</hi> and <hi>supplant;</hi> so the same <hi>Weeds</hi> and <hi>Tares</hi> growing up again by the Errours and Corruptions of that Church, are now choaked and suppressed in those places where <hi>Religion</hi> is divested of that grievous Yoke of <hi>Romish Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,</hi> and reduced nearer to that original purity, in which it was first delivered unto the Saints.</p>
            <p>A Demonstration whereof, are those parts of <hi>Germany</hi> where <hi>Luther</hi> began the <hi>Reformation,</hi> wherein <hi>Trades, Arts,</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> flourish most; the <hi>Hans-Towns</hi> being distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by their multitude of <hi>Labourers,</hi> as well as Regular Life.</p>
            <p>From thence let us Travel to <hi>France,</hi> and there see how <hi>Calvin's Reformation</hi> is attended with the Industrious part of that Kingdom. This might be proved, at large from the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble decay of Trade, since the Persecution of the <hi>Protestants</hi> there, whose Churches were attended with <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> as well as adorned with Learned <hi>Divines;</hi> and in something pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to this are our <hi>Church-wardens</hi> here, whose Duty and Charge is to present such persons whose Vices are the Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants, or rather Natural Consequents of Idleness and Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury. I could easily enlarge the <hi>Resemblance</hi> betwixt these in many Cases (chiefly in suppressing Sloth and Idleness) but the <hi>Office</hi> of a Church-warden being so universally understood in every Parish, I shall not trouble the <hi>Reader</hi> with that which he is supposed to be acquainted with before.</p>
            <p>To return therefore to the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches abroad, you shall find the greatest part of <hi>Discipline</hi> to pass through the hands of the <hi>Laity,</hi> the <hi>Doctrinal part,</hi> and the Administration of the Blessed <hi>Sacraments</hi> thought the work of the Clergy.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96817:14"/> Now see what a mighty Progress has this method of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> met with, and how wonderfully it has succeeded, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst their most Inveterate Enemies the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Germany</hi> it spread with so great an extent, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Party</hi> were afraid, that though it took not up the greatest part of the Countrey, yet that it would of their <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> and leave them none but the unprofitable Rubbish of the Empire, and that stirred up the Empire to consider ways how to stifle and suppress them, which by no Contrivances they were able to effect. God, who works not now by Miracles, uses means and instruments suitable to our Understandings, and agreeable to our lawful interest and improvement in the World; and in proportion to this, the Reformed Churches laid their Methods, instructing their followers in the first Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments or introductory parts of Christianity, Catechising, and preparing their Children and Servants by such of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest and best approved Lay-Elders among them, that were most capable of informing their Clergy of their proficiency and growth in Religion, who were then brought to their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and examined, and after being approved by them, were admitted to a participation of the Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Not unlike to this, is the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> performed by <hi>Bishops</hi> in our <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This course of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> prevailed with great advantage over the <hi>Papists:</hi> For their way of gaining <hi>Converts</hi> was by drawing Men and Women to Idleness and Poverty; vehemently urging the Doctrine of Self-denial, but with no other intent, than to enrich their Church by empoverishing of their blind and ignorant Votaries. This Doctrine, as it was justly odious in its egregious misapplication, by converting what they thus rack'd from their People to sinister uses, in maintaining a numerous breed of Lewd and Idle Men, who lived in all manner of Ease, Luxury, and unlawful Excess; so was it grievous, and uneasie to those who parted with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary support of themselves and Families, to purchace the <hi>Prayers</hi> and Benediction of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Protestants</hi> proceeded in a way diametrically opposite to this, and instructed their Converts as well in the Methods of an Industrious course of Life, as in the Principles of <hi>Religion</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:96817:15"/> and <hi>Vertue:</hi> And at the same time that they educated them in the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and taught them how, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to perform the Offices of Divine Worship; they likewise proved, that one part of their Duty consisted in making a necessary provision for their Families; and that in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures there is not a blacker mark of Infamy placed upon any that violate the Divine Laws, than such as are guilty of that gross omission: And it is remarkable, that in those great Tracts of ground, where Multitudes of Beggers swarm, there is not one of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> among them; which seems to be a signal Blessing in a plain verification of that of the Royal <hi>Psalmist, That he never saw the Righteous forsaken, nor his Seed begging their Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might enumerate an abundant variety of Instances to prove, how Temporal Blessings attend Industry among <hi>Heathens,</hi> and how that just and gracious Providence (who rewards every one according to their Doings) has showered down upon the Gentile World many Secular Felicities and Enjoyments upon that account; but I must remember to keep within my Sphere, which I have limited to Christianity, and more especially to that part of it, which by that inexpressible happiness of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> is more properly and truly such; in pursuit of which design, as I have named <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France</hi> in general, so if we take a Prospect of that little <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which like a <hi>Gem</hi> in a Garment, shines in the midst of its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; the City is as one hand in Labour and Arts: Not a Person to he seen without Employment, and few, or none ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and unconcerned in his Religion, but both making a joint, and (as it were) mutual progress; and indeed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the present State and Condition of that place, there seems to be such a necessity for their dependence one upon another, as that it cannot be supposed, that either could be supported without its Concomitant; and both of them thrive to a miraculous augmentation and improvement; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that they are enclosed and fenced about by Enemies to both: Besides, that it is a City situate within the Land, and has not so large a Territory belonging to it, as appertains to some of our Nobility in their Demeans, yet bears the Characters of a Common-wealth, and if considered in all its
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96817:15"/> Circumstances, in respect of its Circuit, People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may he thought the most formidable place, of so small a Tract of Ground, and so little a number of Men, that is in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>
            <p>The prodigious growth and improvement of the <hi>Ʋnited Provinces,</hi> since the establishing of the Doctrine of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> among them, is so obvious to every Vulgar eye, and so universally known, as needs not to be mentioned in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, only that which respects the case in hand, ought not in reason to be omitted; namely, how considerable a share and interest the <hi>Laity</hi> are entitled to, in the propagation of the Gospel, and encouragement of Religion, arising from their private Instructions, as well as publick example of a Pious and Laborious Life. Their Clergy chiefly respecting it as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Province to be conversant in the publick Exercises of the Ministry, committing the management of Domestick and private Instruction to the <hi>Laity,</hi> it being a received opinion amongst them, as 'tis with most of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> that the Commonalty are best wrought upon, and prevailed with, by the Arguments, Examples, and Converse of their Equals and Companions, and such as are of their own size as to their Fortunes and Station in the World, though not as to their knowledge and experience in Matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>We will now come to our own Countrey, and Plantations, and take a view of that Progress which Religion has attained to, among our selves, and consider by what hands, and in what method most propagated: 'Tis an expression as common as 'tis true, That the <hi>Blood of the Martyrs is the Seed of the Church,</hi> and of all those who gallantly deposited their Lives for the interest of Christ, and his Holy Religion, how many were of the <hi>Laity?</hi> You will not find one in ten of higher Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters: and of those Invincible Champions for the Church, and the Reformation, the generality were Trades-men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, such as laboured with their hands for the support of a Life, which they were ready with such great Courage and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity to lay down, and as an heroick Testimony of their Christian Magnanimity, sealed their Religion with their Blood: None will be so unkind to the blessed Memories of these poor People, but Glorious Martyrs, as to affirm, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96817:16"/> they were not good Instructors in Religion, seeing that 'tis a Maxim acknowledged by all, That Example is more prevalent than Precept.</p>
            <p>But in thus giving a just Character of the worthy carriage of the generally Mechanick Laity, I would not be understood to derogate any thing from that veneration which all of us just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owe to the <hi>Martyrdoms</hi> of those Famous Worthies of the <hi>Church</hi> of those <hi>times,</hi> and blessed <hi>Instruments</hi> of the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer,</hi> &amp;c. These were Heavenly Lamps, who both by their Doctrine and Example have forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly recommended the embracement of the true <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> to all Posterity, and by dissipating the Clouds and Mists of <hi>Romish Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> have so cleared up, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened Christianity with its ancient brightness, that our Ingratitude would be as unpardonable as miraculous, if we should be wanting in any of those publick Testimonies of a profound respect, which their Heroick and Exemplary Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as well as Christian and wise Conduct in the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> may justly require from us. But all this being allowed, as in reason it ought to be, I see not any cause why the Sufferings of the ordinary <hi>Laity,</hi> may not claim a due place in our pious remembrance and esteem of them, nor that we should not account them to have been greatly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental</hi> in promoting and corroborating of the <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> in their Station and Circumstances, as their Martyrdoms and constant perseverance do amply evince.</p>
            <p>From our <hi>Native Countrey</hi> we will pass into <hi>Foreign Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and of those speak something, especially of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and because I would not be <hi>thought</hi> a <hi>friend</hi> to <hi>Separation</hi> from the Church, <hi>as is by Law Established,</hi> I desire therefore to be understood so, as not to represent them a <hi>Precedent,</hi> but an <hi>Instance</hi> only of a wonderful growth in <hi>that Wilderness</hi> by their Industry and publick encouragement in Religion. These People in the space of <hi>twenty years</hi> became the greatest <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> that any Age ever produced, and the visible means was the great industry of the People: Not a Man but was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Labour or Arts, their Children kept at School, and such, whose Quality seated them above mean Employments, were put to the <hi>Ʋniversity,</hi> which they expressed a great Care
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96817:16"/> and Sollicitude at their first Planting to erect. Now to bring this Relation to my purpose, to prove that Artizens, Men of Labour and Employments, have been great instruments in promoting, and advancing the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> I will shew how they have prevailed in the Conversion of divers of those <hi>Heathens</hi> they lived among; and for the better understanding the difficulty that attended the dissuading those Poor Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from their ancient <hi>Gentilism,</hi> I shall shew their manner of Living and Worship when the <hi>English</hi> came among them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Idolaters</hi> they cannot properly be called, because they neither Worshipped the <hi>Sun,</hi> nor <hi>Host</hi> of <hi>Heaven;</hi> nor indeed had they any <hi>Idols</hi> among them: their Worship (if any such they had) exceeding even that of <hi>Idolatry</hi> it self, and consisting in supplicating the <hi>Devil,</hi> and that only upon extremity of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which was done by their <hi>Witches, Priests,</hi> or <hi>Powon,</hi> as they call them, who upon extraordinary occasions raises the <hi>evil Spirit</hi> in the shape of a <hi>Dog,</hi> or any Creature among them. These People then having no publick Rites or Ceremonies of Worship, no Sacrifices, or burthensom Devotion, as other Servile Wretches to that Evil Spirit are miserably intangled in, made it a matter of far greater <hi>difficulty</hi> to bring them off a Life of Liberty, than it can rationally be supposed to be, where Men are loaded with the most extream Rigours, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions, Austerities, Macerating and Cruciating their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies like the <hi>Dervises</hi> among the <hi>Turks,</hi> and several other delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Zealots, both among the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> or such as Sacrificed their Children to appease (as they vainly imagined) their angry Deities. To have prevailed with these to relinquish their Follies, which were so ungrateful to Flesh and Blood, so harsh and awkard to their Natural Inclinations, which exposed them to such mighty hardships, and made their Lives a continued Series of the greatest misery and sorrow that could be inflicted upon Mankind; and in lieu thereof to have embraced the pleasing, and light Yoke of Christianity, would have been a Deliverance from <hi>Exquisite Tortures,</hi> to <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Liberty;</hi> but the Case was otherwise with these <hi>Indians</hi> who were not under any such Severities, and therefore not exposed to such Mortifying Circumstances.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:96817:17"/>
            <p>Another Obstruction was, That these <hi>Indians,</hi> (the <hi>Men</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially) lived as well without <hi>Labour</hi> for their <hi>Bodies,</hi> as <hi>Divine Worship</hi> for their <hi>Souls,</hi> and would not be induced to any thing of <hi>Labour,</hi> lest they should thereby be obliged to <hi>Religion.</hi> Now let us see how many were brought in to be true Converts, and not such as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made in the <hi>West Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas found a difficult undertaking to bring them to <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Publick Instruction,</hi> but first discoursing with the poorer <hi>English,</hi> and being to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now, as hence we may observe the Blessing that attends <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry</hi> in the <hi>Conversion</hi> of <hi>Heathens,</hi> to the <hi>Excellent Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> as has been instanced in this <hi>Foreign Plantation;</hi> so on the contrary, we may see how the <hi>Natives</hi> that live in other <hi>Plantation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> continue in their miserable <hi>Gentilism;</hi> the Reason that may be assigned for it, is, That there our <hi>English</hi> do more indulge themselves in <hi>idleness</hi> and <hi>luxury,</hi> and depend upon the <hi>labour</hi> of <hi>Slaves,</hi> and <hi>Malefactors</hi> that are sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their Crimes, which makes the <hi>Indians</hi> infer this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion from it, That <hi>work</hi> and <hi>labour</hi> is no <hi>Duty,</hi> but a <hi>Punishment.</hi>

            <p>Thus I have given a succinct view of several <hi>Ages</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> since our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> and have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Their <hi>Converts,</hi> and the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians</hi> pursued the same steps, as well in their Lives as Instructions to others; and after a general Defection by the Errors and Innovations of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (which reduced Matters to a Primitive State of <hi>Heathenism,</hi> and consequently degenerated into <hi>Idleness</hi> and <hi>Luxury.</hi>) Our <hi>Reformation</hi> sprang up among the same People of Industry and Labour, who retrieving <hi>Christianity</hi> from the Gross Corruptions of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> reduced it to its first and Ancient Purity, and so encouraged that diligence in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Employments,</hi> which the first Preachers imprinted in their <hi>Gentile Converts;</hi> and such as became <hi>Proselytes</hi> to that most Excellent Doctrine of the Gospel. And as this course was pursued by our selves at home, so has it been carefully attended to by our Countrey-men in our Foreign Plantations of <hi>New-England,</hi> where we have observed, that what Proficiency many of the poor <hi>Indians</hi> have attained to in Christianity, is owing to the instruction, and familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse of the ordinary Mechanick <hi>English,</hi> at whose perswasion they were prevailed upon to make an industrious enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nature and Principles of the Reformed Religion, and consequently to espouse and embrace it.
